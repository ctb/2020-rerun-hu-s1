This is an updated copy of the base pipeline used in [Exploring neighborhoods
in large metagenome assembly graphs using spacegraphcats reveals hidden
sequence
diversity](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02066-4);
the original code comes from
[github.com/spacegraphcats/2018-paper-spacegraphcats/](https://github.com/spacegraphcats/2018-paper-spacegraphcats/),
directory `base-pipeline/`.

The point of this repo is to keep the code running with newer versions of
spacegraphcats, so as to check old against new.
